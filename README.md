# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to provide an earthquake map that shows where the tectonic plates are, where major earthquakes have been and to show this information with different map views.  You are able to click on the icon in the upper right hand corner of the map to change the map view and to also change what layer you would like to view.
